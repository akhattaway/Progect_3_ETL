# Analysis
The number of new design requests that received mockups in February of 2024 was about the same as in 2023, with similar conversion so far for deals that came through the design process in February. 

It looks like new orders (deals having passed through Mockups) are making up about 4% less of the overall revenue for the month, compared to last year.

What is different if we’re not seeing the same growth in incoming design requests as we see in revenue growth? 

    Order Size?
    Product Type?
    Reorders?

What did our incoming requests for design look like in 2023 look like compared to 2024?

    Where did those requests come from?

    What were the client types?

    Were they existing or new business?
